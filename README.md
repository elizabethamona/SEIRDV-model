# SEIRDV model 

To run main file "MCMCV1wCpp.R", you need to source the attached files called "SEIRDV6c.R" and "SEIRDV6.cpp". Once everything is done correctly, you should be able to run this code successfully. The datasets used for both the model analysis and model validation are attached.

This code estimates the model parameters in the SEIRDV model using the MH sampler and simultaneously solves the systems of ODE using Euler method.
