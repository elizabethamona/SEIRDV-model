# Code-for-SEIRDV-model
This code contains code for estimating SEIRDV model parameters using Metropolis Hasting sampler. 
To run main file "MCMCV1Cpp.R", you need to source the other attached files called "SEIRDVc.R" and "SEIRDV.cpp". Once everything is done correctly, you should be able to run this code successfully. 

This code estimates the model parameters in the SEIRDV model using the MH sampler and simultaneously solves the systems of ODE using Euler method.
